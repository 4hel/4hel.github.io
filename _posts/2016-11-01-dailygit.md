From Martin Dilger

The author tells that Git is probably the most important innovation in software development in the last 10 years.

## Basics

When looking at the files in the .git directory there is a config file:

```bash
$ cat config | grep url
# url = https://user@github.com/user/repo.git
```

The `git log` command shows the commit messages for one or all files. The parameter `--oneline` leaves out author and email:

```bash
$ git log --oneline _posts/irre.md
# 7ce9393 fix spelling
# d88cf88 irre
```

The `git status` command shows untracked or modified files.
