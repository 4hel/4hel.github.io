> Trying to be a programmer without understanding how a CPU works is like trying to practice medicine without learning anatomy. Sure, you can have limited success curing patients with medical advice gleaned from Google, but on the whole you're going to be a pretty bad doctor. For those who missed out on learning assembly language, I highly recommend working through this book, even if you'll never program in assembly again. I promise that all kind of lights will go on in your head and you'll be a vastly better programmer.

The author gives an introduction to Programming using Linux Assembly Language

# 1. Introduction

Essentially there are 3 kinds of languages:

* **Machine Language**

  What the computer actually sees and deals with. Every Command is a number or a sequence of numbers.
  
* **Assembly Language**

  The same as machine language, but every instruction is represented by a letter sequence which is easier for a human to remember. Plus some other small improvements.
  
* **High-Level Language**

  Used to make programming easier with a more natural language. A single command is translated to multiple instructions in machine language.
