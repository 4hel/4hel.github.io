From Martin Dilger

The author tells that Git is probably the most important innovation in software development in the last 10 years.

## Basics

When looking at the files in the .git directory there is a config file:

```bash
$ cat config | grep url
# url = https://user@github.com/user/repo.git
```

The `git log` command shows the commit messages for one or all files. The parameter `--oneline` leaves out author and email:

```bash
$ git log --oneline _posts/irre.md
# 7ce9393 fix spelling
# d88cf88 irre
```

The `git status` command shows untracked or modified files.

\"everything\" is stored in the **.git/objects/** database. An object is represented as a binary file named as the hash value of the original content and compressed with zlib. This SHA-1 hash can be created with `git hash-object _posts/irre.md`. There are four types ob objects: **Commit**, **Tree**, **Blob** and **Tag**. The objects can be retrieved via the hash value and pretty printed with `git cat-file -p bf59ee...`. Every commit references its parent commit or 0 in case of the initial commit or multiple parents in case of a merge commit.


## Branch

Branching is the feature that makes git so popular and powerful.

The most upper commit of every branch is called the **head**. It's hash value can be found in **.git/refs/heads/** in files named like the branch. The currently checked out branch can be found in **.git/HEAD**.

Creating a branch:

```bash
$ git branch feature-4711
$ git branch 
#   feature-4711
# * master
$ git checkout feature-4711
```

Resetting the current branch to the status of before the last two commits:

```bash
$ git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

For merging a merge tool is needed:

```bash
$ sudo aptitude install meld
$ git config --global merge.tool meld
$ git merge feature-4711
$ git status
$ git diff
$ git mergetool
$ git status # forgot commit?
$ git log --graph
```

When there is no conflict a fast forward merge is done, just referencing the latest commit from the feature branch.

## Rebase

Imagine you are working on a feature branch and now there a new commits on master which you would also like to have on your branch. Then you say to yourself: **\"I wish I would have created the feature branch today and not yesterday\"** A possible solution would be to merge master to the feature branch but that would lead to a dirty history (graph). So the best choice is to do a

```bash
$ git rebase master
```

on the feature branch. This rewrites the history as if the feature branch has been created after the desired commits on master have been taken place.

You can hardly undo a rebase. Be careful!

## Remotes

A repo can have one or multiple remote repositories. It is a convention name the main remote repo "origin".

### Fetch

```bash
$ git fetch origin
```

Fetches all objects from the remote repo. The working directory remains unchanged.

To apply the fetched remote changes to the working dir use:

```bash
$ git merge origin/master
```

### Pull Merge

To do fetch + merge in one step use:

```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

If a **tracking branch** is configure in *.git/config* it is enough to type:

```bash
$ git pull
```

image of origin history after pull (merge) and push:

### Pull Rebase

```bash
$ git pull --rebase
```

is also possible and does a fetch + rebase instead of merge. This linearises the history. The hash values of the commits are changed. Existing merge-commits disappear because of that. So it can be possible that conflicts must be resolved a second time. Then the rebase must be finished with

```bash
$ git rebase --continue
```

image of origin history after pull --rebase and push:

![origin history after pull --rebase](/img/book/dailygit/pull-rebase.png)

### Push

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

copies the local (commit-) objects to the remote repository and changes it's HEAD-pointer to the latest commit.
This is only possible if the latest remote commit has been pulled to the local repo before. And it can only be pushed to a bare repository.

A forced push is very dangerous. Data can be lost by setting the remote HEAD-pointer in non fast-forward way.

## Reflog

Log of all local actions. Can be used to find commits that are no more part of the history-graph.

## Interactive Rebase

Can be used to rewrite the local history:

```bash
$ git rebase -i HEAD~10
```

The following options are given per commit:

* pick = keep commit as it is
* reword = keep commit but edit commit message
* edit = filed in the working copy can be edited
* squash = keep commit, but meld it into previous one
* fixup = like squash, but discard this commits log message
* exec = rund shell script

## Cherry-Pick

Can be used to copy only single commits from different branches to your current branch:

```bash
$ git cherry-pick fd5eb95
```

This should be done only in exceptional cases, espacially when there is a conflict you will get problems later, so a merge should be prefered.

To see which cherries (commits) from your feature branch have already been picked you can use git cherry. A minus indicates that the cherry has already been picked.

```bash
$ git cherry master
# + 8d1f690170db95684fe0efdbd3f009f1e5c5228c
# + 27e9ec0e8476695d8255309147bd282c699c1e54
# - fd5eb95743913a3fbcc501d02c12a9dbaf9a63de
# + fac3578fc67077da3d2c3261c4184ff7ae2dc5f0
# + 3f693235966ae84f22d5b42e7de827900d0c165e
```

## Hooks

Are bash script located in ```.git/hooks``` which can be executed by git in case of various events.

## Alias

Can be used as shorcuts for less typing of commands which are often needed.

```bash
$ git config alias.go "git checkout"
$ git go master
# switched to branch 'master'
```
