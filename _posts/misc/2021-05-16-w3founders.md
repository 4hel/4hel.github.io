## Muneeb Ali of Blockstack

Former Academic Researcher at Princeton.

He tells about the 2016 Decentralized Web Summit as an historic event with:

Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of www)
Vint Cerf (inventor of TCP/IP)

He compares Ethereum to a Mainframe and Blockstack to network of desktops

Probably most people will not come to web 3 for the privacy and censorship resistence but if they can make money with a web 3 app.

If you have your content on medium or twitter today, the company is making the money, not you
