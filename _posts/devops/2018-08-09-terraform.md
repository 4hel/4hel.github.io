## Infrastructure as Code

### Ad hoc scripts

general purpose programming language

No particular structure enforced

Can become messy and unmaintainable when growing


### Configuration management tools

**Chef**, **Puppet**, **Ansible**, **SaltStack**

Coding Conventions

Idempotence means code can be run multiple times

### Server templating tools

**Docker**, **Packer**, **Vagrant**

used to create an **Image** of a Virtual Machine or Container

Key to the shift to **immutable infrastructure**

### Server provisioning tools

**Terraform**, **CloudFormation**, **OpenStack Heat** are creating servers, databases, load balancers, etc.
