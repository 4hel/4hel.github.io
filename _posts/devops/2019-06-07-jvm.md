## Resources

Traditionally the jvm looks in the **/proc** file system to find out how many cpus and memory is available.
This assumes the whole machine is available and does not work with containers **cgroup** limits.
Additionally one garbage collection thread is started per available cpu core even if the container may use only one cpu.

But in Java 10 `-XX:+UseContainerSupport` is enabled by default, so the container limits are respected.
`-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80` then would use 80% of the containers ram.

For an old version of java the max heap and non-heap areas must be set each:
`-Xmx288m -XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize=32m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=64m` 
this fits for 512m RAM limit.

## Garbage Collection

By default the jvm uses 1% of cpu time for garbage collection. This can be increased with: `-XX:GCTimeRatio=9`
It means that `N/(N+1)` is the part of time for application threads.

Also in a Container before Java 10 it is useful to set `-XX:+UseSerialGC`
