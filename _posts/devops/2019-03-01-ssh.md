## Jump host

The jump host is the gateway to a separate security zone like a private subnet inside a VPC.

The jump host has authorized\_keys of the users but not the private key which is authorized on the target system.

The user needs 2 ssh private keys - one for the jump host and the EC2 provisioned one for the target. ( `ssh-add ~/.ssh/tatu-aws-key` ).

Then:

```bash
ssh -J jumphost.domain.com  ec2user@172.16.0.23
```

## HTTP Proxy

In order to access web servers in a private subnet, the ssh agent can act as a SOCKS5 Proxy on localhost and forward the the traffic through the jump host:

```bash
ssh -fqND 12000 jumphost.domain.com # background
ssh -ND   12000 jumphost.domain.com # foreground
```
