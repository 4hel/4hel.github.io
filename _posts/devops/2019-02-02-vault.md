## CRUD features to store arbitrary secrets

Starting the **Dev Server**.
It stores Data in-memory and listens on localhost without TLS.
It automatically unseals and shows you the unseal key and root access key.

```bash
vault server -dev
```

Configuring the Client

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=
```

Check Status

```bash
vault status
```

Writing and Reading a **Secret** with the **Path** `secret/hello`

```bash
vault kv put secret/hello foo=world excited=yes
```

```bash
vault kv get secret/hello
```

**JSON** is also possible with `-format=json`

and getting a **Field** directly

```bash
vault kv get -field=foo secret/hello
```

**Deleting** a Secret

```bash
vault kv delete secret/hello
```
