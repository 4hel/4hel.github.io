## CRUD features to store arbitrary secrets

Starting the **Dev Server**.
It stores Data in-memory and listens on localhost without TLS.
It automatically unseals and shows you the unseal key and root access key.

```bash
vault server -dev
```

Configuring the Client

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=
```

Check Status

```bash
vault status
```

Writing and Reading a **Secret** with the **Path** `secret/hello`

```bash
vault kv put secret/hello foo=world excited=yes
```

```bash
vault kv get secret/hello
```

**JSON** is also possible with `-format=json`

and getting a **Field** directly

```bash
vault kv get -field=foo secret/hello
```

**Deleting** a Secret

```bash
vault kv delete secret/hello
```


## Secret Engines

By default, Vault enables a secrets engine called `kv` at the path `secret/`

For example the `aws` secrets engine generates AWS IAM access keys on demand.
The `database` secrets engine generates on-demand , time-limited database credentials.

### Enable a Secrets Engine

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=kv kv
```

Because the path defaults to the name of the secret engine this is also possible

```bash
vault secrets enable kv
```

To get more information do a **list** for secrets

```
vault secrets list
```

To see all keys in an do a **list**

```
vault list kv
```

### Disable a Secrets Engine

When a Secrets Engine is disabled, all secrets are revoked and the corresponding vault data and configuration is removed.

```
vault secrets disable kv/
```

### What is a Secrets Engine?

Vault behaves similarly to a virtual filesystem. The read/write/delete/list operations are forwarded to the corresponding secrets engine.
This is a good abstraction. Vault can interact with environments like AWS IAM, dynamic SQL user creation, etc. all using the same read/write interface.


## Dynamic Secrets

```bash
vault secrets enable aws
```

```bash
vault write aws/config/root \
    access_key=AKIAI4SGLQPBX6CSENIQ \
    secret_key=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 \
    region=us-east-1
```

### Create a Role

```bash
vault write aws/roles/my-role \
        credential_type=iam_user \
        policy_document=-<<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1426528957000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

### Generating a Secret

Now that the aws secrets engine is configured with a role, we can ask Vault to generate an access key par for that role by reading from `aws/creds/:role`:

```bash
vault read aws/creds/my-role
```

### Revoke a Secret

To revoke a secret use `vault revoke` with the lease ID:

```bash
vault lease revoke aws/creds/my-role/0bce0782-32aa-25ec-f61d-c026ff22106
```


## Built-in Help

Vault has a built-in help system that can be used via command-line or API.

It can be used for the root path:

```bash
vault path-help aws
```

Or a specific path:

```bash
vault path-help aws/creds/my-non-existent-role
```


## Authentication

When starting vault in `dev` mode it automatically logs you in as the root user with admin permission. In a real setup one has to authenticate first.

### Tokens

Vault supports different authentication mechanisms, but they all funnel into a single session token which we call the **Vault token**.

Authentication is simply the process by which a user or machine gets a Vault token.


You can create more tokens:

```bash
vault token create
```

By default, this will create a child token of your current token that inherits all the same policies. 
When a parent token is revoked, children can also be revoked all in one operation

Revoking a token:

```bash
vault token revoke 463763ae-0c3b-ff77-e137-af668941465c
```

To authenticate with a token:

```bash
vault login s.6zUkHYmLNbrber5bsgUTJaAC
```

### Auth Methods

In practice one should not use `token create` but configure an **Auth Method** like GitHub or LDAP.

```bash
vault auth enable github
```

```bash
vault path-help auth/github
```

A minimal set of configuration is to map teams to policies:

```bash
vault write auth/github/config organization=hashicorp
vault write auth/github/map/teams/my-team value=default,my-policy
```

You can find out which methods are enabled:

```bash
$ vault auth list

Path       Type      Description
----       ----      -----------
github/    github    n/a
token/     token     token based credentials
```

```bash
vault auth help github
```

Login with **GItHub**

```bash
vault login -method=github
```

The auth method can be disabled:

```bash
vault auth disable github
```

This will revoke any logins from that auth method.


## Policies

They control what a user can access. This is called **authorization**.

There are some built-in policies like `root` and `default`.

Policies are authored in **HCL** and are compatible to JSON.

### Writing Policies

A policy can be written from a file:

```bash
vault policy write my-policy my-policy.hcl
```

Or via here document:

```bash
vault policy write my-policy -<<EOF
# Normal servers have version 1 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
# paths:
path "secret/*" {
  capabilities = ["create"]
}
path "secret/foo" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Dev servers have version 2 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
# paths:
path "secret/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["create"]
}
path "secret/data/foo" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```

To see the list of policies run `vault policy list`

To read a policy do:

```bash
vault policy read my-policy
```

Assign a token to the policy:

```bash
vault token create -policy=my-policy
```

### Mapping Policies to Auth Methods

Vault is the only authority for policies. But different auth methods are possible. Auth methods must map identities to policies.

For GitHub it is done per team:

```bash
vault write auth/github/map/teams/default value=my-policy
```


## Deploy Vault

### Configuring Vault

Vault is configured using **HCL** files:

```hcl
storage "consul" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  path    = "vault/"
}

listener "tcp" {
 address     = "127.0.0.1:8200"
 tls_disable = 1
}
```

Start Consul:

```bash
consul agent -dev
```

Start Vault:

```bash
sudo /opt/vault/vault server -config=/opt/vault/config.hcl
```

### Initializing the Vault

Initialization happens only once when the server is started against a new Backend:

```
vault operator init
```

### Seal/unseal

Every initialized server starts in the *sealed* state. The process of teaching Vault how to decrypt the data from the storage is called *unsealing* the vault.

Unsealing has to happen every time vault starts. It can be done via API or command-line. In order to do so you need the *threshold* number of unseal keys, e.g. 3 of 5.

Vault uses an algorith called [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

Let's unseal the Vault:

```bash
vault operator unseal
```

And login with the root token:

```bash
vault login s.PDYIcHu1gAwHNjMTCiqmNk45
```

A single operator can seal the vault:

```bash
vault operator seal
```


## Using the HTTP APIs with Authentication

The REST API can be consumed by an Application using the AppRole auth Method.

The App uses a hard to guess role-id and secret-id in order to authenticate.

The Guide can be found here: [https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/apis](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/apis)

It is missing there to create the dev-policy:

```hcl
path "secret/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}
```


## Web UI

When the Dev Server is started, the UI can be found here:

[http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui](http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui)

For a Non-Dev Server the UI must be activated in the config:

```hcl
ui = true

listener "tcp" {
  # ...
}

storage "consul" {
  # ...
}
```
