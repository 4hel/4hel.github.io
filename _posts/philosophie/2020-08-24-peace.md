Wisdom from Naval [https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289) 

We say that we want peace of mind but what we really want is peace from mind.

All chases, whether flow, drugs, beauty, thrills, orgasm, or devotion, are attempts to escape from the mind. 

Meditation is the direct path.

Meditation is your birthright. It's your natural state. 
It requires no one, needs no thing, and has no technique.

If something requires a guru, a mantra, or a teaching, it isn't universal, and it won't free you.
