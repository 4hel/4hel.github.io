## 1. Installation

On Centos check SELinux with `sestatus` and do `setenforce 0`

### Docker

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker andre
# 
# new repo was added...
#
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list 
deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo debian-jessie main
```

### Compose

[https://github.com/docker/compose/releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)

## 2. First Steps

### Basics

Hello World:

```bash
docker run debian echo hello world
```

Start Bash in container and attach:

```bash
docker run -it debian bash
root@02156d24da81:/#
```

Show containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND              CREATED              STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
02156d24da81        debian              "/bin/bash"          About a minute ago   Exited (0) 6 seconds ago                       practical_kilby
574cd4f977f4        debian              "echo hello world"   5 minutes ago        Exited (0) 5 minutes ago                       stupefied_bartik
```

Filter inspect json with Go template

```bash
docker inspect --format {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} awesome_swartz 
172.17.0.2
```

Show file system diff:

```bash
docker diff awesome_swartz 
A /test
C /bin
D /bin/echo
```

Show logs:

```bash
docker logs awesome_swartz 
root@99c4fcfc87bf:/# rm /bin/echo 
root@99c4fcfc87bf:/# touch test
```

Delete container:
```bash
docker rm awesome_swartz
```

Delete all exited containers:
```bash
docker rm -v $(docker ps -aq -f status=exited)
```

Check Union File System:
```bash
docker info | grep Storage
# Storage Driver: overlay2
```

### Redis Example

Get official redis image from the library:
```bash
docker pull redis
```

Start redis container like a daemon with -d :
```bash
docker run --name myredis -d redis
```

Start a second container for running redis-cli. The --link creates an /etc/hosts entry for myredis:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --link myredis redis /bin/bash
root@14f64e1dcf91:/data# redis-cli -h myredis
myredis:6379> ping
PONG
myredis:6379> set key 1234
OK
myredis:6379> save
OK
```

In the official redis Dockerfile there is `VOLUME /data`. With another container, importing the myredis /data volume + mounting a backup volumes, we can create a backup of this data:
```bash
mkdir backup
docker run --rm --volumes-from myredis -v $(pwd)/backup:/backup debian cp /data/dump.rdb /backup/
ls backup
```

## 3. Fundamentals

### Build Context

The **Build Context** contains the Dockerfile as well as files which are copied to the image. It can be a local directory like "." or "git://..." repo or "github.com:/...". But is is recommend to clone a repo locally instead of specifing a git url directly

### Image Layers

Every command in a Dockerfile results in a new image **layer** in the Union File System:

```bash
docker history 4hel/cowtainer
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT
f5937212a838        6 hours ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoin...   0 B                 
ebb5a3d4d1da        6 hours ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) COPY file:423f47cb060a1b...   108 B

<missing>           10 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:41ac8d85ee35954...   123 MB  
```

### Caching

**caching** is used when there already exists a layer with the same parent and the same docker file command. So `RUN git clone` might be cached and not get the latest result.


### Base Image

**debian** is normal. **busybox** is really small. But **scratch** is a completely empty file system, where only one static binary is added.

To update to latest version of the base image one needs to explicitly do `docker pull image`.


### Dockerfile Reference

Can be found here: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)


### Volumes

Volumes are either created at runtime with `docker run -v /data ...` or in in a Dockerfile using `VOLUME /data`.

Per default they are mounted from a dir below /var/lib/docker, but the mount point in the host file system can be explecitly changed with -v HOSTDIR:CONTAINERDIR. In the Dockerfile it is not possible to set the host mount point for security and flexibility reasons.


### Exec

In an entrypoint.sh script it is important to use bash `exec` in order to replace the bash process instead of creating a child process. This garantees that Signals like **SIGTERM** are not swallowed by the parent process.

### Socket Mounting

When running for example Jenkins in a container, it can be necessary for the container to create **sibling containers** on the host. This is made possible with **socket mounting**: The docker cli client needs to be available in the jenkins container, whith jenkins user in /etc/sudoers. The IPC-Socket file needs to mounted inside the jenkins container: `docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ...`.


## 4. Logging

### Default Output

By default, the STDOUT and STDERR of the Process are protocolled:

```bash
docker run --name logtest debian bash -c 'echo "stdout"; echo "stderr" >&2'
docker logs logtest 
# stdout
# stderr
docker rm logtest
```

To follow the the stream -f is used:

```bash
docker run -d --name streamtest debian bash -c 'while true; do echo "tick"; sleep 1; done;'
18ea0bef55084e4061b69fdb74274a7e12bc12352918ff7481788c385df7dd1d
docker logs -f streamtest 
# tick
# tick
# tick
# ...
```

### Log Driver

The argument --log-driver can be passed to docker run:

* **json-file**

  Standard logging as shown above
  
* **syslog**

  using the standard syslog network protocol
  
* **journald**

  the driver for the systemd journal
  
* **gelf**

  using the Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)
  
* **fluentd**

  forwarding logs to fluentd
  
* **none**

  disable logging

```bash
docker run --log-driver fluentd --log-opt tag="debug.{{.Name}}" -p 8080:8080 mylogger
```

```bash
docker run --log-driver syslog --log-opt syslog-facility=local0 --log-opt tag=mylogger -p 8080:8080 mylogger
```

## 5. Limit a container's resources

By default, a container has no resource constraints and can use as much of a given resource as the hostâ€™s kernel scheduler allows.

### Memory

**hard limit** Docker enforces that the container can not use more than the given amount of memory.

**soft limit** is only enforced under certain conditions when the host kernel detects low memory or contention. But it is not guaranteed that the container does not exceed the limit.

The options take a positive integer, followed by a suffix of `b`, `k`, `m`, `g`


`-m` or `--memory=` : The amount of memory the container ca use. (hard limit)

`--memory-reservation` Specifies a sot limit smaller than `--memory`


There is also `--kernel-memory` which relates to cgroup kernel memory accounting: [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/memory.txt)

In theory, setting a kernel limit lower than the user limit would allow to overcommit the memory per cgroup. But in the cgroup-v1 implementation this does not work.
But it is possible to set a kernel limit >= user limit.


### CPU

The CFS is the Linux Kernel CPU scheduler for normal Linux processes.

Docker 1.13 or higher:

`--cpus=<value>` Specify how many of the available CPUs the container can use:

```bash
docker run -it --cpus=".5" ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Docker 1.12 or lower:

```bash
docker run -it --cpu-period=100000 --cpu-quota=50000 ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Here the scheduler period is set 100.000 microseconds and the container is allowed to run up to 50.000 microseconds.

`--cpu-shares` Set this flag to a value greater or less than the default of 1024 to increase or reduce the containers weight. It only prioritizes CPU Usage, but does not guarantee or reserve CPU access.
