Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## node

Without argument it launches a JavaScript REPL

## npm

The Node Package Manager npm can install packages in local or global mode.

In **local mode** it installs the package to the folder `node_modules` in the current working directory.

in **global mode** packages are installed to `/usr/lib/node_modules/` which needs `sudo`.

### Changing Location of Global Packages

Change the prefix to a folder in the HOME dir:

```bash
cd ~ && mkdir .node_modules_global
npm config set prefix=$HOME/.node_modules_global
$ cat .npmrc 
# prefix=/home/andre/.node_modules_global
```

Then reinstall npm and add new global bin dir to $PATH:

```bash
npm install npm --global
# add .bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.node_modules_global/bin:$PATH"
which npm
# /home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global/bin/npm
```


### Installing Packages in Global Mode

The Flag `--global` or just `-g` is used.

```bash
npm install uglify-js -g
```

### Listing Global Packages

The installed packages with a full dependency graph are shown with

```bash
npm list -g
```

In order to see just packages we do:

```bash
npm list -g --depth=0
```


### Installing Packages in Local Mode

For local installation a `package.json` file is used most of the time:

```bash
npm init
```

creates the file:

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

It is modified when a new dependency is installed:

```bash
npm install underscore
```

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "underscore": "^1.8.3"
  }
}
```
