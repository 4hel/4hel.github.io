## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build
./rclone version
```

## Configuration

The configuration is interactive:

```
rclone config
```

The config is written to: `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`

In the config there is a **remote** or multiple remotes.

## Sync

Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.

The **sync** can also delete files. if not wanted use **copy**.

The source folder must be given for the target too:

```
rclone sync test/ gdrive:test
```

## List

Usefull for encrypted directories:

```
rclone ls secret:
```

List directories only:

```
rclone lsd gdrive:
```

## Mount

works on all operating systems

```
rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount
```
where /path/to/local/mount is an **empty, existing** directory

Mount runs in foreground mode by default, use the `--daemon` flag to specify background mode.

When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually:

```
# Linux
fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
# OS X
umount /path/to/local/mount
```

Under the hood **VFS** is used: **Virtual File System**

### Limitations

Without the use of `--vfs-cache-mode` this can only write files sequentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without `--vfs-cache-mode writes` or `--vfs-cache-mode full`. See the File Caching section for more info.

### Caching

```
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache. (default 5s
```
## Encryption

The crypt remote encrypts and decrypts another remote. (into a subdirectory. give: `remote:path`)

You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote which will encrypt and decrypt from that directory which might be useful for encrypting onto a USB stick for example.
