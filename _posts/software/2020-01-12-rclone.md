## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build
./rclone version
```

## Configuration

The configuration is interactive:

```
rclone config
```

The config is written to: `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`

In the config there is a **remote** or multiple remotes.

## Sync

Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.

The **sync** can also delete files. if not wanted use **copy**.

The source folder must be given for the target too:

```
rclone test/ gdrive:test
```

## List

Usefull for encrypted directories:

```
rclone ls secret:
```

List directories only:

```
rclone lsd gdrive:
```

## Encryption

The crypt remote encrypts and decrypts another remote. (into a subdirectory. give: `remote:path`)

You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote which will encrypt and decrypt from that directory which might be useful for encrypting onto a USB stick for example.
