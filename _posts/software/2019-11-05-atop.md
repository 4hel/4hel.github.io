## Installation

`sudo apt-get install atop`

## system level area

The top area is for system level metrics. There is 

* `PRC` process totals
* `CPU`
* `CPL` CPU load information
* `MEM`
* `SWP` swap
* `PAG` paging frequency
* `LVM` / `MDD` / `DSK` logical volume/multiple device/disk utilization
* `NET` network information

## process level area

similar to top.

the output can be controlled:

* `g` generic output (default)
* `m` for memory
* `d` for disk related
* `n` for network related
* `v` for various process information
* `c` for the command line of the process

## background running

the daemon is running as a systemd unit:

`systemctl status atop`

it is restarted daily:

`cat /etc/cron.d/atop`

it writes historical data to `/var/log/atop/` as one file per day

this can be viewed by reading the file:

`atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_20150617`
