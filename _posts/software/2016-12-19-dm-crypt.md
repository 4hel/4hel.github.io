## 1. Intro

**dm-crypt** is an encryption module of the linux kernel's [Device Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper).
It encrypts the backing-device (the real hard disk) and provides the clear text content as a virtual block device via /dev/mapper.

The userspace utility **cryptsetup** is used to setup the disk encryption.

**LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup) is an extension, which adds a header for metadata and keys. So it becomes a **container** for a dm-crypt volume. LUKS hinders [plausible deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability).

## 2. FAQ

[Full FAQ](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions)

* SSDs / Flash Drives
  Can not reliably erase, because they just reference from sector pools.
  
* Cloning / Imaging
  Makes a copy of the luks header and thus of the master key, which stays the same even if the passphrase is changed later.
  
* Distribution Installers are DANGEROUS

* Passphrase is not the Master Key
  It only decrypts the randomly selected master key
  If a new header is created with the same passphrase, the master key is dirrent and thus all data is lost

## 3. Header

Every encrypted Volume has a header section. If this header gets damaged or lost, then it is impossible to recover the data.

Check a header:

```cryptsetup -v isLuks <device>```

Backup a header:

```cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup --header-backup-file <file> <device>```

Restore a header:

```cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore --header-backup-file <file> <device>```


## 4. Basic Setup

Install cryptsetup:

```sudo aptitude install cryptsetup```

Wipe file system and data:

```cat /dev/zero > <target device>```

Create the LUKS Container:

```cryptsetup luksFormat <target device>```

Print the header:

```cryptsetup luksDump <target device>```

Map the container:

```cryptsetup luksOpen <target device> mycontainer1```

Wipe the container:

```cat /dev/zero > /dev/mapper/mycontainer1```

Create file system:

```mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/mycontainer1```

Mount the file system:

```mount /dev/mapper/mycontainer1 /mnt```

Remove a Volume step 1:

```umount /dev/mapper/mycontainer1```

Remove a Volume step 2:

```cryptsetup luksClose mycontainer1```


## 5. Using a loop-device

Create an empty file:

```head -c 100M /dev/zero > luksfile```

Map the file to /dev/loop0:

```losetup /dev/loop0 luksfile```

Do Setup etc...:

```cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/loop0```
